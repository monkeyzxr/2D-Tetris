My Game of Tetris! (DO NOT COPY IT FOR SCHOOL HOMEWORK!)

****************************************************
7 different falling shapes are composed of 4 squares. 

The large rectangle size is 10 to 20 suqares.

We could pause the game when the mouse cursor is inside the large rectangle.

A small rectangle on right side shows the next shape which would soon appear in the large rectangle.

The falling speed of shapes can be set by users.

The falling direction of the shapes is controlled by the mouse button. Each click on the left mouse button moves the falling shape to the left by one square, and similarly, the right button moves the shape to the right by one square.

A forward scroll of the mouse wheel will rotate the shape clockwise and a backward scroll will rotate the shape counter-clockwise.

The score is calculated based on the the number of disappeared horizontal rows.

A user-friendly interface is created to adjust various parameters.
